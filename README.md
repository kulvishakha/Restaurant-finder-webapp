# Restaurant-finder-web application

Created an web application which takes area ZIP code as an input from user and displays the details of the restaurants within that ZIP code. If there is no restaurant in the given ZIP code, then it should reflect “no restaurants in the given ZIP code”. 

Developed an application using MVC(Model View Controller Design Pattern)framework which follows Bottom-Up Design approach. 

It uses OOP Concepts such as Inheritance, Abstraction and Object-Oriented Design.


Functional Workflow:
1. The Restaurant Finder which is  user-friendly interface  where users can see the best-rated restaurants in his/her locality.
2. On the search bar, the user could search for the restaurants either by using the zip code or by the name of the restaurant itself.
3. When the user searches for the restaurant by its name, the restaurants are filtered by the name parameter.
4. If the user clicks on the link of the desired restaurant, they are directed to the website of the restaurant.
5. The admin of the website can perform CRUD operations with regards to the restaurants and their details by the login to the portal.
6. On this page, the admin can change the desired functionalities of the restaurant like updating the working hours, modifying the ratings, deleting the restaurant if it has closed down etc.
7. Finally, when the admin saves these changes, when the user searches for the same, the update modifications are visible on the User Interface.
